# youtube_async_searcher

Project Goal
To make an API to fetch latest videos sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response.

Basic Requirements:
Server should call the YouTube API continuously in background (async) with some interval (say 10 seconds) for fetching the latest videos for a predefined search query and should store the data of vid eos (specifically these fields - Video title, description, publishing datetime, thumbnails URLs and any other fields you require) in a database with proper indexes.
A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in descending order of published datetime.
It should be scalable and optimised.
Bonus Points:
Add support for supplying multiple API keys so that if quota is exhausted on one, it automatically uses the next available key.
Make a dashboard to view the stored videos with filters and sorting options (optional)
Instructions:
You are free to choose any search query, for example: official, cricket, football etc. (choose something that has high frequency of video uploads)
Try and keep your commit messages clean, and leave comments explaining what you are doing wherever it makes sense.
Also try and use meaningful variable/function names, and maintain indentation and code style.
Submission should have a README file containing instructions to run the server and test the API.
Submission should be done on GitHub Externship Portal.
Reference:
YouTube data v3 API: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started
Search API reference: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list
To fetch the latest videos you need to specify these: type=video, order=date, publishedAfter=<SOME_DATE_TIME>
Without publishedAfter, it will give you cached results which will be too old
